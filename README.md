# GitWithTheProgramme

Hobo,
stop that pointless commit.

Do it now, 
your merge doesn’t fit.

But how?

Follow my lead, 
you’ll GIT like a Linus.

You need it bro,
you´re on minus.

I’ll help you GIT faster,
...branch and prune...
…to avoid disaster.

GIT with the programme,
fix and stage like a true master.
