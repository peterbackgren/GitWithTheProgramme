# GitWithTheProgramme

Hobo,
stop that pointless commit.

Do it now. 
Your merge doesn’t fit.

But how?

Follow my lead. 
You’ll GIT like a Linus.

You need it bro.
You´re on minus.

I’ll help you GIT faster...
Branch and prune.
To avoid disaster.

GIT with the programme.
Fix and stage like a true master.
